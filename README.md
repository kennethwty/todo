<h3>Screenshots of the To-Do list:</h3><br>
1) This is the default setup that you will see every time you visit the app. The app gets reset back to this after you close the tab, so make sure you finish whatever that you have to finish for that day :)

2) When you hit the + sign, the input field fades down for you to type a new todo.

3 & 4) When you are done with a task, simply click on it and it will get crossed off. You can also hit the trash can icon to completely remove the task instead of crossing it off.
